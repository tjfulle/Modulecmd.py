.. _basic-usage-modulepath:

------------------
The ``MODULEPATH``
------------------

Modulecmd.py searches for modules in the user's ``MODULEPATH``.  ``MODULEPATH``
is a colon separated list of directories containing modules.  ``MODULEPATH`` is
to modules what ``PATH`` is to executables.

In the following examples, a mock ``MODULEPATH`` is used.  You can set an
identical mock ``MODULEPATH`` and follow along in your shell by executing

.. code-block:: console

  $ module tutorial basic
  ==> Setting up Modulecmd.py's basic mock tutorial MODULEPATH

This command purges any loaded module and resets the ``MODULEPATH`` to the mock
directories used in this tutorial.  Modulecmd.py can report to you the current
value of ``MODULEPATH`` with the ``path`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module path
  1) ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1
  2) ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2

.. note::

  The exact path displayed may differ from the paths shown depending on
  your operating system.  The final two directories (``basic/1`` and
  ``basic/2``) should be present.


.. _basic-usage-avail:

----------------------
List available modules
----------------------

The subcommand ``avail`` lists available modules:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module avail
  --- ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1 ---
  A  B (D)  C/1.0  C/2.0

  --- ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2 ---
  B  C/1.0  C/3.0 (D)


Several modules are shown as available.  The unversioned modules ``A`` and
``B``, and the versioned module ``C`` with versions ``1.0``, ``2.0``, and
``3.0``, spread across the two directories on ``MODULEPATH``.

Where an unversioned module exists in more than one directory, or a module has
multiple versions, the suffix ``(D)`` indicates its default version.  The
default version is chosen by the following rules:

- If a module is unversioned (such as modules ``A`` and ``B`` above), the first
  module on ``MODULEPATH`` is the default.  In the above example, module ``B``
  in ``~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1`` comes before the
  module of the same name in ``~/Library/Application
  Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2`` and is, thus, the default.

- If a module is versioned (such as module ``C`` above), the highest logical
  version across all directories is chosen as the default.  Accordingly, version
  ``3.0`` of module ``C`` is its default.

.. note::

  There are yet other ways of determining and specifying defaults.  These will
  be covered in the intermediate tutorial.

.. _basic-usage-avail-filtered:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Filtering list of available modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list of available modules can be filtered by regular expression as ``module
avail <regex>``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module avail C
  --- ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1 ---
  C/1.0  C/2.0

  --- ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2 ---
  C/1.0  C/3.0 (D)

Now, only modules matching the regular expression (``C`` in this case) are
shown.


.. _basic-usage-info:

-------------------------------------
Displaying information about a module
-------------------------------------

Modulecmd.py can report basic information about modules on ``MODULEPATH``.
A modules file path is displayed using the ``find`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module find C
  C/1.0
    ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1/C/1.0.py
  C/2.0
    ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1/C/2.0.py
  C/1.0
    ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2/C/1.0.py
  C/3.0
    ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2/C/3.0.py

Note that the file paths for all of module ``C``\ s versions were displayed.  To
display the file path of a single version, give ``find`` a more qualified name:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module find C/3.0
  C/3.0
    ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/2/C/3.0.py

The contents of the module shown with the ``cat`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module cat A
  setenv('A', 'A-1')
  set_alias('ls-a', 'ls -a')

We see that the module ``A`` sets the environment variable ``A`` to the value
``A-1`` and alias ``ls-a`` to ``ls -a``.

The subcommand ``more`` also shows the contents of a module, but pages through
the output, similar to the Linux ``less`` command.

The subcommand ``show`` shows the commands that would be executed by the shell
when the module is loaded:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module show A
  A="A-1";
  export A;
  alias ls-a='ls -a';

.. note::

  The commands shown above are the commands that would be executed by the
  ``bash`` shell.  For other shells, the commands will be different.

The subcommand ``whatis`` displays more detailed information about the module

.. code-block:: console

  $ module whatis A
  ====================================== A =====================================
  Name: A
  Family: None
  Full Name: A
  Filename: ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1/A.py
  ==============================================================================


.. _basic-usage-load:

-----------------------------
Loading and unloading modules
-----------------------------

The subcommand ``load`` loads a module.  When a module is loaded, its commands
are translated and sent to the shell.  To load the module ``A`` do:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module load A

The ``list`` subcommand lists the loaded modules

.. code-block:: console

  $ module list
  Currently loaded modules
      1) A

Note, the module ``A`` is shown as loaded.

Letâ€™s verify that loading ``A`` had an effect on the shell.  We previously
displayed the contents of ``A`` and saw it set the environment variable ``A`` to
``A-1``.  Let's verify this variable was set

.. code-block:: console

  $ echo $A
  A-1

Loading the module ``C`` loads the default version

.. code-block:: console

  $ module load C
  $ module ls
  Currently loaded modules
      1) A  2) C/3.0

(``ls`` is alias for ``list``).  As expected, version ``3.0`` of ``C`` was
loaded.  To Load a specific version, specify the name and version:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module load C/1.0

  The following modules have been updated with a version change:
    1) C/3.0 => C/1.0

The previously loaded version of module ``C`` was unloaded and version ``1.0``
loaded in its place.

.. code-block:: console

  $ module ls
  Currently loaded modules
      1) A  2) C/1.0


Two modules ``C/1.0`` exist on ``MODULEPATH``.  Which one was loaded?  The
subcommand ``info`` gives basic information about a loaded module

.. code-block:: console

  $ module info C

  Module: C/1.0
    Name:         C
    Version:      1.0
    Modulepath:   ~/Library/Application Support/Modulecmd.py/basic/1

As expected, the module loaded was the first on ``MODULEPATH``.


To unload a module, issue the ``unload`` subcommand

.. code-block:: console

  $ module unload C
  $ module ls
  Currently loaded modules
      1) A

.. _basic-usage-reload:

------------------
Reloading a module
------------------

It is sometimes necessary to reload a module.  Issuing ``load`` on an already
loaded module issues the following warning:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module load A
  ==> Warning: A is already loaded, use 'module reload' to reload

The ``reload`` command must be issued to reload an already loaded module:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module reload A

.. _basic-usage-swap:

----------------
Swapping modules
----------------

Two modules are swapped with the ``swap`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module swap A B
  The following modules have been swapped
    1) A => B

.. code-block:: console

  $ module ls

  Currently loaded modules
      1) B

----------------------------
Adding to the ``MODULEPATH``
----------------------------

The ``use`` subcommand adds paths to ``MODULEPATH``.

------------
Getting help
------------

Several methods exist for generating help on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module -h

will give display basic subcommands of Modulecmd.py.  The subcommand ``help``
displays an extended help:

.. code-block:: console

  $ module help

To get help on a specific subcommand execute

.. code-block:: console

  $ module <subcommand> -h

intermediate tutorial, we expand on these concepts and introduce other concepts
that are useful for working with your shell's environment.
